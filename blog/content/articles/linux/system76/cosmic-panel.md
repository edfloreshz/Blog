After a few months of development, System76 has finally released the first official pictures of what the new COSMIC desktop will look like, specifically the COSMIC Panel.

# Applets

Looks like System76 is moving away from the traditional "extensions" and plans to design an API for third party applets, this is similar to what KDE, XFCE and others are doing.

So far, we know that these applets will be able to be placed in the dock and the top panel, but this may not be the only places we might see them.

This is exciting news, this will make COSMIC a much more powerful desktop environment, making it extendable and customizable.

Let's get our first look.

# Sound Applet

Perhaps one of the most exciting ones is the new sound applet.

right off the bat, we notice a big change compared to the previous version.
