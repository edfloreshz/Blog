How have you been?

I've been thinking about writing about my experiences, thoughts, and ideas for a while now, but I've been putting it off for a long time.

When I was younger I had a general idea of how my life was supposed to go, but as I've grown older, I've realized that life doesn't always go as planned.
For most of my adult life I feel like I've been living on autopilot, I went to college, got a job, and I've been working ever since, thinking that it
would eventually take me to my destination, but that destination seems even further away now.

As expected, I became exhausted, but the last couple of months I've had a lot of free time, and I've been thinking about
what I want to do next. I realized that I need to take control of my life, and start making decisions that will take me where I want to go, not wait
patiently for things to happen.

This blog isn't going to be exclusively technical, I'll write about the journey I'm about to embark on. I'm not striving to be a professional writer
nor I'll pretend to be one, however, I'll try to improve my skills as I write these entries.

I hope you'll find it interesting.
